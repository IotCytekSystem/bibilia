          <p>
            Armed with a desire to empower its members economically, Biblia Sacco created the investment arm of the society christened as Biblia Housing Co-operative Society Ltd, hereafter referred to as BHCS. The mandate of the Housing wing was to venture into investment in land and housing for the benefit of members. After some initial teething problems, BHCS has grown in leaps and bounds and currently its assets stand at Ksh 55 Million. BHCS has enabled its members to acquire plots in prime areas in addition to paying attractive dividends. The most recent gift to its members was a dividend of 30% on shares and an interest of 10% on deposits for the year ended 31st December 2014. This is one of the best payouts in the market.
